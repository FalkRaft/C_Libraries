# C_Libraries

This is the where my C libraries are stored and shared. You can use these files to act as an extension to your C code/project.
Such files include:
 • emath.h
  - This is where the basic and advanced math functions (excluding math.h functions) are written in.
  - Those functions for example are:
     - Area of a Circle (areacirc(double radius))
     - Surface area of a Cylinder (areacylin(double radius, double height))
     - Pythagoras' Theorem for the longest sections of a rectangle (pytheo(double x, double y))

NOTE: This is still currently under development.
