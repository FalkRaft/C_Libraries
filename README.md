# C_Libraries

This is the where my C libraries are stored and shared. You can use these files to act as an extension to your C code/project. This it is meant to be a library for basic C functions that can make writing your C code faster. A bonus of this is that this is compatible with C++.

To download the header files, navigate to the header file you want and click on the icon to download it.
Such files include: [emath.h](https://github.com/FalkRaft/C_Libraries/blob/main/README.md#emathh).
# [emath.h](https://github.com/FalkRaft/C_Libraries/blob/main/C_Libraries/emath.h)
 • This is where the basic and advanced math functions (excluding math.h functions) are written in.
 • Those functions for example are:
   - Area of a Circle (areacirc(long double radius))
   - Surface area of a Cylinder (areacylin(long double radius, long double height))
   - Pythagoras' Theorem for the longest sections of a rectangle (pytheo(long double x, long double y))

NOTE: This is still currently under development. If you want to download the compiled version of the header files, then it will only work for MacOS.
